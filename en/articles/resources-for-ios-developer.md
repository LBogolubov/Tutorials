There are several useful resources for iOS developers. I have not organized the links by rating. The links are grouped by material type - video, text, news, etc.

The description under each resource is collective feedback from the community. It's meant to help you get oriented more quickly.

If you know of any good resources, [contact me](https://t.me/ivanvorobei) and I'll add them here.
